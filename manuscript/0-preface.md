# Preface

This book came about because I was attempting to migrate from Gogs to Gitea.  I'd been a fairly content Gogs user for several years, having started back around the time that Gitea was first forked from Gogs.  At that point, there wasn't a clear reason to use Gitea except for the potential that community management promised.

In mid 2019, however, I decided to check in on Gitea again, to find it flourishing!  Added features and functionality put it well ahead of Gogs, with no signs of stopping.  All that was left was to spin up a Gitea instance and migrate my data.  Doing *that* meant understanding how to set up a Gitea instance, for which there wasn't, in my opinion, sufficient documentation.

If there's one advantage to being a software developer, it's that an open-source codebase is effectively free documentation: I could go straight to the source (pun intended, sorry!) and see *exactly* what happened as the service was starting, see what values were being used and where they came from, and so on.  Further, the best way to really understand something is to explain it to someone else... hence, this book!
